# defiQuant CMC Strategy Skill

Use this skill to turn CoinMarketCap market data into BNB Chain target weights
without executing trades.

## Inputs

- BNB Chain token universe restricted to `configs/eligible_tokens.json`.
- Daily OHLCV candles from CoinMarketCap for each configured symbol.
- Strategy config from `configs/strategy.json`.

## Procedure

1. Load the configured token universe and reject symbols outside the hackathon allowlist.
2. Fetch daily CMC OHLCV data for the requested lookback.
3. Score non-stable tokens with the shared alpha pool:
   - medium-term momentum,
   - fast/slow trend strength,
   - recent volume impulse,
   - liquidity depth,
   - short-term reversal and blowoff guard,
   - normalized trend angle,
   - Supertrend alignment,
   - volatility penalty.
4. Build the non-executing Track 2 regime strategy spec:
   - `up_channel_long_bias`: use when support holds, trend angle is positive,
     Supertrend is positive, price is above the Ichimoku-lite cloud, and volume
     confirms participation.
   - `down_channel_short_bias`: use when support breaks or fails to reclaim,
     trend angle is negative, Supertrend is negative, price is below the
     Ichimoku-lite cloud, and volume confirms distribution.
   - `range_or_transition`: use when the factors disagree and the skill should
     not express a directional preference.
5. Apply risk guardrails:
   - max drawdown circuit breaker,
   - max position weight,
   - minimum stable reserve,
   - daily turnover cap,
   - explicit fee and slippage assumptions.
6. Return target weights with the reason tuple for each asset, plus the optional
   non-executing regime strategy spec when requested.

## Local Commands

```powershell
uv run defiquant signal --fixture --config configs/strategy.json
uv run defiquant signal --config configs/strategy.json --cmc-days 90
uv run defiquant track2-regime-spec --fixture --config configs/strategy.json
uv run defiquant track2-regime-spec --config configs/strategy.json --cmc-days 90
uv run defiquant backtest --config configs/strategy.json --cmc-days 90 --cmc-end-date 2026-06-12
uv run defiquant research-report --windows 90,180,365
```

Use fixture mode for deterministic package review. Use CMC mode only when
`CMC_API_KEY` is configured.

## Output Contract

Return JSON-compatible objects shaped like:

```json
{
  "symbol": "CAKE",
  "target_weight": 0.1,
  "score": 0.0757,
  "reasons": [
    "medium_momentum=-0.0292",
    "trend_strength=-0.0402",
    "volume_impulse=0.0123",
    "liquidity_depth=0.6950",
    "short_reversal_guard=0.0000",
    "trend_angle=-0.3552",
    "supertrend_alignment=-1.0000",
    "volatility=0.0060"
  ]
}
```

## Safety Boundary

This skill is Track 2 only. It must not call TWAK, sign transactions, place
orders, or mutate any wallet state. Execution happens only through the Track 1
adapter after the risk manager has produced a separate order plan.

The package includes deterministic examples in `examples/` and submission notes
in `SUBMISSION.md`. These files are part of the Track 2 bundle and must remain
free of secrets, wallet commands, live execution instructions, registration
steps, and funding instructions.
